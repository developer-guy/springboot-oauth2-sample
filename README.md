# Simple Springboot OAuth2 Project

This project contains two applications.One of them oauth2-server and the other oauth2-client.Our oauth2-server project protects the oauth2-client Rest API's.If user want to send requesto to oauth2-client Rest APIs , the user must be authenticate to oauth2-server .

## Running

Firstly , you must run oauth2-server to provide token to users.
Inside OAuth2ServerConfiguration.class you will see the client's credentials, so you can get token like this :

curl -XPOST "trusted-app:webapp@localhost:9091/oauth/token" -d "grant_type=password&username=user&passsword=passsword"

After you get the access token you can send the http request to oauth2-client:

curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer access_token" http://localhost:9090/api/hello --> This request will be work.
curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer access_token" http://localhost:9090/api/admin --> This request will return access_denied error , becuase this user doesn't have ROLE_ADMIN role.

If you want to send request to /api/admin you should login with admin user.

curl -XPOST "trusted-app:webapp@localhost:9091/oauth/token" -d "grant_type=password&username=admin&passsword=passsword"
